# Division by Zero Error in C

This repository demonstrates a common error in C programming: division by zero.  The code attempts to divide an integer by zero, leading to undefined behavior. This can manifest in various ways, from crashes to seemingly random results.

The `bug.c` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.c` provides a corrected version that avoids the error using a simple check.
